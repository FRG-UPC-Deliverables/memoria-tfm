\chapter{The Sleuth Kit JavaScript}

The Sleuth Kit (TSK) is an open source cross-platform collection of terminal
applications and a C library that allows investigators to analyze disk images
and recover files from them \cite{tsk-web}. It is divided in file system and
volume tools. 

The fist group, file system tools, serve to examine the file system of a suspect
computer in a non-intrusive way. Main file system tools are shown on Figure
\ref{T:tsk-fs-tools}.

{\bf Command }	& {\bf Description }  \\ \hline \hline
fsstat & Shows file system details and statistics \\ \hline \hline
fls	& Lists allocated and deleted file names in a directory \\ \hline
ffind & Finds allocated and unallocated file names \\ \hline \hline
icat & Extracts the data units of a file \\ \hline
\end{tabular}

Volume tools are in charge of the layout of disks and another media. They are
needed to identify where partitions are located to be able to proceed with a
file system analysis. Table \ref{T:tsk-v-tools} lists main volume tools.
